ERC20

> ERC-20 is a widely used standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The term ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the number that was assigned to this particular standard.  
>   
> An ERC-20 token is essentially a smart contract that represents a digital asset or currency. It defines a set of rules for creating and managing the tokens on the Ethereum network, including how the tokens are transferred, how many tokens are in circulation, and how users can access them. These tokens can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as creating a new cryptocurrency, managing digital assets, or even creating new financial instruments.  
>   
> One of the key advantages of the ERC-20 standard is that it allows developers to create interoperable tokens, which means that they can be traded on any exchange or wallet that supports the standard. This makes it much easier for users to manage their tokens and for developers to create new applications and services that can leverage the power of the Ethereum blockchain.

IPFS

> IPFS stands for InterPlanetary File System, which is a decentralized protocol and network for storing and sharing files. It is a peer-to-peer system that allows users to store and access files on a distributed network of computers, rather than a centralized server.
