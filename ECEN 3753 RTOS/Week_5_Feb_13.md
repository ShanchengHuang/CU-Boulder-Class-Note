# Scheduling

- Max thoughput
- Max utilized
- Min Response time
- Min wait time
- Min start a new task
- Share resources appropriately

## Criteria for Scheduling

- CPU Utilization
- Response Time
- Turnaround Time 
- Wait Time


## Non Preemptive Scheduling

- Cooperative multitaskling
- Non-preemptive scheduler

## Preemptive Scheduling

## Scheduling Algorithms

- First-Come, First-served
  - Pros: No context switch
  - Cons: Slow
- Shortest Job First
  - Pro: Max Task throughtput
  - Con: Lager Task potentially would wait forever, hard to konw when the task done.
  - Unit test: 
- Time slice 
  - Pro: Fully deterministic
  - Con: Task has nothing to do during emptry
- Time Slice with Background Tasks
- Round Robin
- Priority
